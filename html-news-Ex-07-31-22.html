China, well-aware of its bolstered position on the world stage, has released a furious stream of warnings about Pelosis visit. China views her Taiwan trip as an affront, an insult and a purposeful nose-thumbing of the "One China" policy America agreed to in 1979. As part of that agreement, the United States recognized the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, and acknowledged that Taiwan is part of China. The Chinese government doesn't take kindly to any insinuation that America is treating Taiwan as "separate" from the mainland,or that America is encouraging an independence movement in Taiwan.
